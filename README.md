# Plover Q&A

[![Build Status][Build Status image]][Build Status url] [![linting: pylint][linting image]][linting url]

This [Plover][] [extension][] [plugin][] contains [metas][] for your
dictionaries that can assist with [Q&A][] (Question and Answer): the process of
recording lines of questioning in a conversation involving multiple people,
usually in a legal context.

More information about the concept of Q&A can be found at:

- [Platinum Steno Lesson 27 QA video][]

More information about the creation of, and reasoning behind, the outlines that
originally informed this plugin can be found at the following blog post:

- _[Plover For the Record][]_

You can see a video of the plugin in action here:

- [Steno Legal Q&A Test with Plover and Vim][]

(And if you are a [Vim][] user and want the syntax highlighting, you can find it
in the [Vim Steno Q&A][] plugin)

## Install

1. In the Plover application, open the Plugins Manager (either click the Plugins
   Manager icon, or from the `Tools` menu, select `Plugins Manager`).
2. From the list of plugins, find `plover-q-and-a`
3. Click "Install/Update"
4. When it finishes installing, restart Plover
5. After re-opening Plover, open the Configuration screen (either click the
   Configuration icon, or from the main Plover application menu, select
   `Preferences...`)
6. Open the Plugins tab
7. Check the box next to `plover_q_and_a` to activate the plugin

## Config and Dictionaries

See the [`examples`][] directory for example configuration and dictionaries to
help you get up and running with using this plugin for Q&A.

## How To Use

See the [`INSTRUCTIONS`][] page.

## Development

Clone from GitHub with [git][]:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:paulfioravanti/plover-q-and-a.git
cd plover-q-and-a
```

### Python Version

Plover's Python environment currently uses version 3.9 (see Plover's
[`workflow_context.yml`][] to confirm the current version).

So, in order to avoid unexpected issues, use your runtime version manager to
make sure your local development environment also uses Python 3.9.x.

### Testing

- [Pytest][] is used for testing in this plugin.
- [Coverage.py][] and [pytest-cov][] are used for test coverage, and to run
  coverage within Pytest
- [Pylint][] is used for code quality
- [Mypy][] is used for static type checking

Currently, the only parts able to be tested are ones that do not rely directly
on Plover.

Run tests, coverage, and linting with the following commands:

```console
pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing
pylint plover_q_and_a
mypy plover_q_and_a
```

To get a HTML test coverage report:

```console
coverage run --module pytest
coverage html
open htmlcov/index.html
```

### Deploying Changes

After making any code changes, install the plugin into Plover with the following
command:

```sh
plover -s plover_plugins install .
```

> Where `plover` in the command is a reference to your locally installed version
> of Plover. See the [Invoke Plover from the command line][] page for details on
> how to create that reference.
